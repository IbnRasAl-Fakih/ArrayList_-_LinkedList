# ArrayList_-_LinkedList
In this project was created classes MyArraylist and MyLinkedList, which are realizations of ArrayList and LinkedList respectively. There is a general interface, that called MyList, which includes several methods: add, add using index, get, size, remove, remove using index, indexOf, lastIndexOf, contains, clear. Using this classes you can create array of integers, array of strings and so on, because the classes are general. All methods were tested, that's why I hope all of them work correctly, without any errors. If I have time, I'll create all methods that have Arraylist and LinkedList. 
All files is located in the 'master' branch.
